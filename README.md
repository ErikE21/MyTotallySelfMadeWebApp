# Pokemon Teambuilder and editor
A Project for me to use my imagination and put my coding skills to the test.

The Api wrapper was not made by me!
Source code of the wrapper is [here](https://github.com/jtwotimes/PokeApiNet)

The Api can be found [here](https://pokeapi.co).

# Use

1. Either click on the "Pokemon!" button or the "pokemon" button in the navigationbar.
2. You will see a table with 25 pokemon, on the bottom of the page you can click one of the other pages to look at more pokemon. You can also add or change the number at the end of the url to jump to that specific page.
